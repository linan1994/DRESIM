# DRESIM
Dynamic Resilient Infrastructure Simulation and Management

A primitive demo for the cascading failure and resilient repair. 
See the User Manual file for the interface description, code explanation, and the usage instruction. 

The file SingleRepair allows one node repair at a time. The file SimultaneousRepair allows the repair of multiple nodes at the same time. 

Yalmip(https://yalmip.github.io/) is required to run the files. 

Factored graph and variable elimination are applied to obtain the suboptimal decision for large-scale interdependent infrastructure network.
